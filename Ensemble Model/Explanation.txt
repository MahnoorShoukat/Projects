For improving the classification performance in dress recommendation, I have combined the predictions from three base learners such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the ensemble model. The stacking ensemble was examined on a different testing set after being trained on a specific training set. When compared to the individual models, the findings showed a considerable improvement in accuracy. After applying fold cross-validation, the accuracy of the stacking ensemble model increased to an impressive 81%.
