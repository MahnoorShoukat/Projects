# Petrol & Gas Prices Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes worldwide petrol and gas prices along with related economic indicators. A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand important variables and their relationships, focusing on oil consumption patterns, pricing variations, and economic impacts across different countries.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the 'Petrol_Gas_Prices_Worldwide' dataset which contains information about:
Countries
Daily oil consumption in barrels
Price per gallon (USD)
GDP per capita
World share percentages
Yearly gallons per capita
Other related metrics

## Data Preprocessing
Removed unnecessary columns like 'S#'
Converted string representations of numerical data to appropriate data types
Handled comma separators in numerical fields
Calculated world share percentages based on daily oil consumption

## Analyses
1. Price Distribution Analysis

Visualized distribution of fuel prices using KDE plots and histograms.
Identified price patterns and outliers across different regions.

2. Correlation Analysis

Created correlation matrices to understand relationships between variables.
Identified key factors influencing fuel prices globally.

3. Top Oil Consuming Countries

Identified and visualized the top 10 countries by daily oil consumption.
Analyzed their world share percentages.
Found that the United States has the highest consumption (20.39% world share).

4. Economic Impact Analysis

Examined the relationship between GDP per capita and fuel consumption.
Analyzed yearly gallons per capita consumption patterns.
Identified that Germany has the lowest yearly gallon per capita among top consumers.

5. Price Comparison

Compared fuel prices across major oil-consuming nations.
Found that Saudi Arabia has the lowest price per gallon (USD) among top consumers.

6. Regional Analysis

Conducted a focused analysis on Pakistan and its neighboring countries.
Compared oil consumption patterns in the South Asian region.
Determined that India has the highest daily oil consumption in the region.
