
This project is the Chatbot Development using large language model and advanced retrieval augmentation
using Langchain as a framework. 

Loading data using lang-chain loaders, splitting the documents into chunks creating an embedding for the chunks, putting them into vector store, and combining the retrieval algorithms with the #LLM. Retrieved documents and user questions passed to the LLM and generated an answer to the original question.

Langchain as a framework, and using GPT-3.5 as a Language Model (LLM), This QnA ChatBot 
capable of extracting information from any PDF file. I have added a pdf file, asking questions, 
and having the ChatBot generate responses based on the content of file.
